			<P> Majority invests in technology startups that </P>



			<ul> 

				<li>a) improve the earnings of people living on under Rs. 500 ($6) a day. </li>

				<li> b) build scalable solutions to tough problems. i.e. Startups which can reasonably target 50+ million customers within a few years. </li>

				<li> c) India-first solutions but can also scale to similar geographies like South East Asia and Africa in a few years. </li>

				<li> d) Have a profit orientation, and an eye on unit economics.</li>

			</ul>

			</P>
			
			<P> We have scaled tech businesses to millions of customers, held P & L responsibilities, and delivered impact to millions. 
				Hence we are able to strike a balance between the two heads of impact and results. </P>
